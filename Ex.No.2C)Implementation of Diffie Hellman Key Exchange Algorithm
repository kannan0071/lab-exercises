##AIM:

To implement the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange algorithm using C language.

##DESCRIPTION:

Diffieâ€“Hellman Key Exchange establishes a shared secret between two parties that can be used for secret communication for exchanging data over a public network. It is primarily used as a method of exchanging cryptography keys for use in symmetric encryption algorithms like AES. The algorithm in itself is very simple. The process begins by having the two parties, Alice and Bob. Let's assume that Alice wants to establish a shared secret with Bob.

##EXAMPLE:



##ALGORITHM:

STEP-1: Read the plain text from the user.

STEP-2: Read the key value from the user.

STEP-3: If the key is positive then encrypt the text by adding the key with each character in the plain text.

STEP-4: Else subtract the key from the plain text.

STEP-5: Display the cipher text obtained above.

##PROGRAM:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include<conio.h>
#include <ctype.h>
void main()
{
    char plain[10], cipher[10];
    int key,i,length;
    int result;
    //clrscr();
    printf("\n Enter the plain text:");
    scanf("%s", plain);
    printf("\n Enter the key value:");
    scanf("%d", &key);
    printf("\n \n PLAIN TEXT: %s",plain);
    printf("\n \n ENCRYPTED TEXT: ");
    for(i = 0, length = strlen(plain); i < length; i++)
    {
        cipher[i]=plain[i] + key;
        if (isupper(plain[i]) && (cipher[i] > 'Z'))
        cipher[i] = cipher[i] - 26;
        if (islower(plain[i]) && (cipher[i] > 'z'))
        cipher[i] = cipher[i] - 26;
        printf("%c", cipher[i]);
    }
    printf("\n \n AFTER DECRYPTION : ");
    for(i=0;i<length;i++)
    {
        plain[i]=cipher[i]-key;
        if(isupper(cipher[i])&&(plain[i]<'A'))
        plain[i]=plain[i]+26;
        if(islower(cipher[i])&&(plain[i]<'a'))
        plain[i]=plain[i]+26;
        printf("%c",plain[i]);
    }
    getch();
}
```
